1. Make the tool works as all kinds of interaction in RFC 2131;
2. /*  Refer to RFC 2131
   If the 'giaddr' field in a DHCP message from a client is non-zero,
   the server sends any return messages to the 'DHCP server' port on the
   BOOTP relay agent whose address appears in 'giaddr'. If the 'giaddr'
   field is zero and the 'ciaddr' field is nonzero, then the server
   unicasts DHCPOFFER and DHCPACK messages to the address in 'ciaddr'.
   If 'giaddr' is zero and 'ciaddr' is zero, and the broadcast bit is
   set, then the server broadcasts DHCPOFFER and DHCPACK messages to
   0xffffffff. If the broadcast bit is not set and 'giaddr' is zero and
   'ciaddr' is zero, then the server unicasts DHCPOFFER and DHCPACK
   messages to the client's hardware address and 'yiaddr' address.  In
   all cases, when 'giaddr' is zero, the server broadcasts any DHCPNAK
   messages to 0xffffffff.

   So we could use "ciaddr" instead of 'giaddr'
